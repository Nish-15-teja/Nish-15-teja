👋 About Me 
Hey there! I'm **Nishvika Teja**, a passionate developer and AI/ML enthusiast who loves building smart, impactful systems.  
I enjoy exploring the intersection of **Software Engineering + AI**, and I'm currently growing my skills in Java, DSA, ML, and full-stack development.

I'm driven by curiosity — whether it's understanding how intelligent systems behave, optimizing solutions through good engineering principles, or building clean and functional applications.

Hackathons, projects, and hands-on learning are where I feel most alive.
